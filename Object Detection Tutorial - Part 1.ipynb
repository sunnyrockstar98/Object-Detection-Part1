    "# Object Detection - PART - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "With the recent developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Machine Learning applications like Object Detection and Face Detection have gained high popularity and many countries like China are implementing these applications in large scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can you stay ahead of the curve??\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows is a series of tutorials on Object Detection where you will understand the algorithm from the scratch and then learn how to use one of the best apis available these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But why Object detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have all heard about the industrial revolution sommewhere in our history books and it may seem like a thing of the past but today with the advent of IoT, Cloud Computing, Blockchains and Artificial Intelligence we are entering into the era of the next industrial revolution -  **\"Industry 4.0\".** \n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks are getting automated and various jobs and industries are getting disrupted. In 2018, surprisingly most of the jobs getting automated are the ones which required ocular presence. For example systems like **Self-Driving cars**, intruder or burglar alert sysems, People Counters, **Face Recognition** for entry at places, Vehicle Inspection and Detection, Product Identification in Manufacturing Industry, **Fault Detection** for Insurance Industries, Marketing of similiar products after brand ID and many more countless and still under development applications are making their way into our everyday life and work.\n",
    "\n",
    "And all these applications work on either the simple or more custom - made advanced prototypes of Image or Object Detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Well if you engineer a self - driving car you would definitely want something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt odroad](odroad.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But how do we make a computer output something like that with just a simple image or video-feed??\n",
    "\n",
    "Well we need to have a look at what is called image classification and object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a black-box here - \n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Classification** is taking an image, feeding it into a network of neurons( a special network called **CNNs**) and getting the image classified into one of the classes we had trained our network to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Detection** is a more advanced version of the Image Classification problem where it contrasts with the fact that an Object Detector will have to search an image for commonly-known( or trained) objects and if found state what object it is along with confidence of the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you train a CNN to predict just a lion or a tiger or a zebra that is an image classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if your program can automatically locate the animal in any image you provide and tell you - that here is the animal in this image and I am 90% confident about it!! - then that is an Object Detetctor for you\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's dig deeper....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Image Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple convolutional neural net - looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt conv](conv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying principle is that any image can be represented as a matrix of pixel values - like every RGB image is a pixel matrix of the order (m,n,3).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A CNN takes in an image as an input applies various filters on it and various other image processing techniques so as to get a suitable matrix of numbers which can classify that image into any one of the desired number of categories we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### But how can the CNN network actually know how to classify??\n",
    "\n",
    "Well first ofcourse the network architecture has to be decided upon and then it has to be trained and only then can the network on any new image perform classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is just like teaching a child what is a bird or a dog and then asking it to tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the network and its neurons are initialized with random weights and trained with various images and the weights keep updating with more training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when this trained network is given any image it goes through the whole process again with those weights and outputs a vector which is interpreted as a category and classification process is over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ConvNet has four main operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convolution\n",
    "2. Non Linearity (ReLU)\n",
    "3. Pooling \n",
    "4. Classification (Fully Connected Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Convolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "For sure the electrical engineers know very well what a convolution operation is mathematically. Without touching the math a lot and intuitively put in case of  ConvNets is - \n",
    "\n",
    "Extract features from the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what are features??\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Vertica Edges in a Image\n",
    "    - Horizontal Edges in a Image\n",
    "    - Bright/Dark areas\n",
    "    - If a person is smiling or not\n",
    "    and many more.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To illustrate -\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt image](image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the matrix form of your input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt filter](filter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the filters you are using in your CNN to detect some particular feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this one below is finally the convolved feature output of your convolution image.\n",
    "If this image pixel is matrix is converted back to your image you can see the features detected in your image.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is a really exciting excercise to figure out what features you want to detect and how do you come up with a series of filters for your CNN\n",
    "![alt filtered](filtered.png)\n",
    "### 2. Non-Linearity (ReLU layer):\n",
    "\n",
    "It is basically used to convert negative pixel values into zero values.\n",
    "This takes care of the non - linearity from the images as convolution was a linear operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you give ReLU layer an input feature map:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt relupng](relupng.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Pooling:\n",
    "\n",
    "After convolution and ReLU has been applied next step in our image processing is Pooling which helps reducing unwanted dimensions from our feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various kinds of pooling like max,average,min and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "These image will make it clear what happens when you apply pooling to a pixel matrix after convolution and relu:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt pool](pool.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can decide on stride of window, how many pooling layers you want for your custom application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Fully Connected Layer and Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final step for the CNN and our image is almost ready to be classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last output step of the CNN FC layer computes the scores for the classes which we need to classify into.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Putting it all together:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt convnet](convnet.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end it depends on you how many layers and neurons you want for your application.\n",
    "\n",
